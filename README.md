# NeuroHex-ANN-Controlled-Robot-for-Autonomous-Navigation-and-Environment-Perception
This is my Final year project in my UG from RNSIT, Bangalore. The project is based on implementing Object detection and also controlling the robot which is a 6WD Vehicle through real world. 
This project, NeuroHex, is an autonomous robot that leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for intelligent navigation and environment perception. Designed to handle complex and uneven terrains, the robot uses a fusion of hardware and software components to perceive its surroundings, detect objects, and navigate autonomously.

## Software and Hardware Setup 
Both hardware and software requirements are equally essential for reaching the aim of the project. A good hardware is what which is going to drive the necessary tools and applications of software meet the required result metrics.

### Hardware Setup
First, we are going to setup our hardware which is foundation. The hardware setup includes both mechanical designing of project and also electronic setup. The
